**Last updated:** [30/01/2026]

## 1. Overview

DroidPHP (the “App”) is developed and maintained by our organization (“we”, “us”, “our”).
We value user privacy and are committed to transparency.

**We do not collect, store, or process any personal data directly.**
All core functionality of the App runs locally on the user’s device.

## 2. Data Collection by the App

The App itself **does not collect**:

* Personal information (such as name, email address, phone number, or address)
* Location data
* Usage analytics or tracking data
* User-generated content
* Files, code, or data processed within the App

We do not operate backend servers or databases that store user information.

## 3. Third-Party Services

Although we do not collect data directly, the App may include third-party services that operate independently and may collect information according to their own privacy policies.

### 3.1 Google AdMob

The App may display ads provided by **Google AdMob**.

Google AdMob may collect certain data, such as:

* Advertising identifiers
* Device information
* Ad interaction data

This data collection is **controlled entirely by Google** and is not managed by us.

The App uses **Google Play Billing** for in-app purchases.

Google may collect information related to payments and transactions.
We **do not have access to payment details or financial information**.

## 4. Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or transfer user data.
Any data processed by Google services is handled solely under Google’s policies.

## 5. Children’s Privacy

The App **does not have a minimum age requirement** and is not specifically targeted at children.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
Since the App does not collect personal data, no special data handling is performed for minors.

## 6. Data Security

Because we do not collect or store personal data, we do not maintain user databases or servers containing personal information.

Device security and operating system protections are handled by the Android platform and the user.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
Any changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date.
